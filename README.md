# 🅾️ Optimism Name Service

The Optimism Name Service (ONS) is a distributed naming system based on the Optimism blockchain, highly inspired by the [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/) (ENS). The purpose of this system is to allow users to manipulate readable names like 'lola.opt' rather than long cryptocurrency addresses.

## Project stage
The project is at the prototype stage and is currently being deployed and tested on the Kovan blockchain.
