The Optimism Name Service (ONS) is a distributed naming system based on the [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) blockchain, highly inspired by the [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/) (ENS). The purpose of this system is to allow users to manipulate readable names like 'lola.opt' rather than long cryptocurrency addresses.

The project is at the prototype stage and is currently being deployed and tested on the Optimism Kovan blockchain.
